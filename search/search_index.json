Design Goals New Relic Dashboard Builder was designed to help solve the problem of effectively managing a large and growing number of dashboards used to monitor a wide variety of services. It aims to fulfill two design goals that could not be met with using the New Relic UI to create and maintain dashboards: Allow New Relic dashboards to be managed in source control by defining them in simple, human-readable text files. Reduce duplication of query definitions to support easier maintenance of dashboards by Allowing the same query definition to be reused in multiple dashboards. Allowing portions of queries to be combined and reused across multiple queries. The design of New Relic Dashboard Builder was inspired by the Jenkins Job Builder tool. Installation The New Relic Dashboard Builder command line tool that can be installed from PyPI using pip pip install nrdash Usage To use New Relic Dashboard Builder, you must first acquire an admin New Relic API key . Once you have an admin API key, you can provide the admin API key and your dashboard configuration YAML file to the New Relic Dashboard Builder command line tool. nrdash --api-key <YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY> --account-id <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> <DASHBOARD_DEFINITION_YAML_FILE>","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"New Relic Dashboard Builder is a command line tool for declaratively configuring New Relic dashboards using YAML files.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#design-goals","text":"New Relic Dashboard Builder was designed to help solve the problem of effectively managing a large and growing number of dashboards used to monitor a wide variety of services.

Each widget has a size and location on the dashboard as well as an NRQL query that defines the data that is displayed by the widget. Suppose we wanted to create a dashboard consisting the following widget: This dashboard could be defined in a YAML definition file as dashboards: sample-dashboard: title: Sample Dashboard widgets: - widget: query: title: Transactions by Response Status nrql: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transaction WHERE transactionType = 'Web' FACET response.status visualization: facet_bar_chart row: 1 column: 1 width: 3 height: 2","title":"Guide"},{"location":"guide/#guide","text":"This guide provides a walkthrough for getting started with using New Relic Dashboard builder to define and manage your New Relic dashboards.","title":"Guide"},{"location":"guide/#basic-query-and-dashboard-definitions","text":"New Relic dashboards are composed of one or more widgets.
